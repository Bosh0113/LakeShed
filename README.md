# LakeShed: a web-based tool for watershed delineation considering lakes and reservoirs
## Introduce
This is an web-based tool for watershed delineation considering lakes and reservoirs. The delineation results provide five types of spatial units: lakes, rivers, river sub-basins, lake hillslopes, and unchanneled flow paths.

### Key functionalities include:
- Supports watershed delineation for any region of interest worldwide.
- Allows users to customize extraction parameters, including the minimum upstream contributing area for river extraction and the minimum lake area to exclude small lakes.
- Supports user-uploaded DEM data for watershed delineation.
- Watershed delineation is processed by a remote server.
